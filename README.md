# Virtual HOTAS

A customizable virtual controller to play flight sims. Supports both modes - phone only and phone with controller.

## Background

It is hard to play flight simulators without a Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS). To accurately control the throttle, you need to know its position at all time, keyboards and controllers can't do that. To control the joystick, you need analog input, most keyboards cant do that but controllers are great at it. 

This app converts your phone into a virtual HOTAS. You can now control your throttle and flaps using sliders, and your joystick using your phone's sensors.

You can also extend the capability of the app by pairing a controller.

## üß© Components

Basic rundown of different parts of this app - \
**vJoy** - Creates a virtual joystick that this app uses. https://www.vjoy.org/ \
**Monitor vJoy** - Comes with vJoy. Use this to monitor and troubleshoot input. \
**pyVjoy** - Python bindings for vJoy https://github.com/maxofbritton/pyvjoy \
**index.html** - UI for the this app. \
**main.py** - Backend to process the data from index.html.

## ‚öô Customization

To keep things simple. All css, body and scripts are in index.html.

### Change button names

Change the text in the button

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary button" onclick="buttonPress(1)">Gear Up</button>
```

### Change layout

The layout is done using CSS Grids.

### Change sliders

Sliders are done using noUiSlider. https://refreshless.com/nouislider/

### Add buttons

Add a button in index.html using using the snippet below. Change the number in buttonPress(#) to an unassigned number.

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary button" onclick="buttonPress(#)">Gear Up</button>
```

Update layout. Based on the type of customization you might have to update the CSS grid.\
Open vJoyMonitor to check if the input is being reported correctly.

## ‚ùî Troubleshooting

### I can't figure out how to fly 
- Tap the reset button while flying to level the aircraft. Make small adjustments to your phone and you'll get the hang of it. 
- Check if the controls are mapped inside MSFS.

### General troubleshooting steps
Run python app again and then refresh webpage.
Refresh webpage.
Check vJoy Monitor

### Throttle in Microsoft Flight Simulator is erratic

This is a known issue for MSFS. It is not just for this app, it seems to be an issue for other peripherals too. \
To fix - Disable AI assists in MSFS.

### How do I know I'm connected?
Open vJoy Monitor and look see if your input is being registered.

## üöÄ Beyond HOTAS
1. Accessibility tools - Just by renaming the buttons we can configure this for any game. By running the app on a bigger screen, we can make bigger targets for increased accessibility. 
2. Stream deck - you know how to make a UI and send inputs, it should be possible to connect to an API for OBS. 

## üó∫ Roadmap
- Update logic of UI buttons to report long press. Right now, I can only record a tap but not long or sustained button presses.

## üéπ Keybindings 
### Phone only
The buttons on the UI will register as 21 and beyond on vJoy

### Phone with Backbone
All the buttons and axes of Backbone are mapped in the order in which they are reported from the controller.
